Minesweeper
===========

This is a quick implementation of the classic Minesweeper game done in Angular.

It is self-contained in one file for deployment on github pages

Check out the deployed result here: [ramdog.github.io/minesweeper](http://ramdog.github.io/minesweeper/)

Feel free to write me some feedback here on on my blog, [where I wrote about this exercise](http://www.ramintaleghani.com/2014/07/minesweeper.html).
